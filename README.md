# Netflix Clone 프로젝트 🎬

이 저장소는 React 기반으로 만든 **넷플릭스(Netflix) UI 클론 프로젝트**입니다.  
영화/TV 콘텐츠 리스트, 슬라이드 UI, 간단한 API 연동 등을 통해 실제 넷플릭스와 비슷한 경험을 구현했습니다.

---

## 🧩 기능  
- 메인 화면에서 영화/TV 콘텐츠 목록 슬라이드 방식으로 표시  
- 검색 기능 (사용자가 키워드 입력 시 관련 콘텐츠 표시)  
- 상세 페이지 (각 콘텐츠 클릭 시 상세 정보 보기 가능)  
- 반응형 디자인 적용 (데스크탑, 모바일 모두 대응)  
- 간단한 API 연동 (예: TMDB 등 외부 영화 API 사용)  
- 개인 브랜치(“madelily”) 기반 작업 완료 후 `main` 브랜치에 병합 및 동기화

---

## 🛠 사용 기술 스택  
- React  
- React Router  
- Axios (API 요청)  
- Styled-Components 또는 CSS 모듈 (스타일링)  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Git & GitHub (브랜치 전략: `madelily` → `main`)  

---

## 🚀 설치 및 실행 방법  
다음 명령을 로컬 저장소 클론 후 프로젝트 폴더에서 실행하면 됩니다:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/groom-for/netflix.git
cd netflix
npm install
npm start

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
=======
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
